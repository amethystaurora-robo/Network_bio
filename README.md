This project analyzes the effect of ethoprophos on Daphnia magna gene expression levels collected at 3 different doses on 9 timepoints.

Each code file contains a header which details its use.
The DynGENIE3 file requires a wrapper doc, available from https://github.com/vahuynh/dynGENIE3

Input and output order is as follows:
Pre-processing_visualization.ipynb -> GRN_pre-processing.ipynb -> dyngenie_trial.R -> DynGENIE3_analysis.R -> process_results.R
